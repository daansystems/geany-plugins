About
=====

ESLint is plugin for Geany that enables linting Javascript files using ESLint.
Files are automatically linted based on the available eslint installation.
Issues are shown as annotations in the editor.
A new linting process is started when loading or saving a Javascript file.

Usage
=====

Enable the plugin in plugin manager. If any errors occur these are shown in the messages tab.
The ESLint plugin requires a working NodeJS installation. It tries to find the 
node executable in PATH or in "C:/Program Files/nodejs/node.exe".
A small script is started that loads eslint as module. It tries to load eslint from
the current javascript node_modules tree or from a system wide installation.
